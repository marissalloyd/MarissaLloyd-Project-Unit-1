        <p>I am 23 years old and am currently enrolled in Treehouse Techdegree program. I'm a mother to a beautiful 4 year old girl. I began nannying in 2018 after my daughter was born.
            While going to school for early childhood care development to eventually take on a career in early schooling. Being a mother as well as a nanny, has taught me lessons and has improved me as an overall person.
            I have aquired more ability in my patience, multitasking and problem solving skills. After COVID-19 hit, it took a toll on my outlook on the career in childcare and education.
            I continued to nanny, but began looking at other avenues of options for a career that would efficiently maintain the lifestyle my daughter and I had built for ourselves.</p>
            <p> While looking through my options to find
                a substantial career, while trying to find something that was of my interest. I began researching the IT field. I've always been knowledgeable on basic computers, including Microsoft, as well as interested in seeing thing through and trying my hardest in everything I have set my mind to in order to substantially provide for myself and my family.
                Due to this, I love learning and tend to pick up new tasks and lessons quickly, but am not afraid to ask questions or state my concerns if uncertain.</p>
