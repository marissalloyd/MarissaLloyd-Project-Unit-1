        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Originially, I had began going to school for early childhood education. I was also working as a nanny, to try and get more experience with kids without going into the 
          daycare enviroment as I had just had my first child and she was too little to go into any facility. After a two years of nannying experience as well as classes, I decided to try becoming a early education teacher at a local preschool.</p>
        <p>Not long after starting the teaching job, COVID-19 hit. Finally coming to my senses as to this career path might be more of a helath risk than a ideal career for me.
          I began looking into IT, but still was unsure as to what field I would be a good fit for.</p>
          <p>When I came across the Web Developing field, I began my extensive research into that career, not long after did I sign up for Treehouse.</p>
          <p>I've been enjoying my learning experience with the Treehouse community. I'm excited for my future project and what experiences I'll have in the future.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to begin a career in IT Web Development, I think it has the creative and technical aspect, I've been looking for while allowing me to design and express myself through other peoples visions.</p>
        <p>I hope to complete and master my IT techdegree and jump start my career in the technical field.</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope to eventually find a career as a web developer in order to create and design beautiful websites for companies that are looking for something different and made customly.</p>
        <p>I'm also hoping to incorporate my artistic abilities, with the benefit of giving my designs more specially made, personal spin on my site pages that I create.
        </p>
        <p>I'm excited to get started and contiue growing my abilities to become a well off web developer.</p>
